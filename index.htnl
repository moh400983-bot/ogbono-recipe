    Instructions
</h2>
<ol>
<li>Wash and cut the meat into bite-sized pieces, then boil with a pinch of salt, chopped onion, seasoning cube, and a little water until tender (about 20–30 minutes). Soak the stockfish or dried fish in warm water for 10–15 minutes, then tear into pieces.</li> <br>
<li>Grind the ogbono seeds into a fine powder (if not already ground) and mix with 2–3 tablespoons of water to form a smooth paste.</li> <br>
<li>Heat palm oil in a medium pot over medium heat, add the ogbono paste, and stir continuously for 2–3 minutes until the oil and ogbono combine.</li> <br>
<li>Gradually add 2 cups of water or meat stock while stirring to prevent lumps from forming.</li> <br>
<li>Add the cooked meat, stockfish or dried fish, crayfish, and blended pepper, then simmer on low heat for 10–15 minutes.</li> <br>
<li>Stir in the washed spinach, ugu, or bitterleaf and cook for 3–5 minutes until the vegetables are tender but still vibrant.</li> <br>
<li> Taste the soup, adjust with salt or seasoning cube if needed, and simmer gently for 2 more minutes before serving.</li>
